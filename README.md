# Image Classification CNN Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing the process of creating an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for images of size 150 x 150. The project explores various CNN configurations to identify the most effective model for image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Intel Image Classification" dataset, which can be found at the following link: [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).

**Important Note**: The dataset is not included in this repository. To execute the notebook successfully, you must download and extract the dataset into this repository beforehand.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from the provided [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).
3. Extract the dataset into the root of the cloned repository.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the analysis and results.
